# Status

This project has been effectively **SUPERSEDED** by @warricksothr's [RustBuild] as I'm no longer
building nightly binaries. This project won't receive further updates or bug fixes.

[RustBuild]: https://github.com/warricksothr/RustBuild

If you are looking for nightly Rust and Cargo builds to natively compile Rust programs **on** an
ARM device, then check the [RustBuild] project I mentioned above.

If you are just looking for cross compiled crates to cross compile to ARM, then you can use the
[official builds]. If you want information on how to cross compile, check my extensive cross
compilation guide: [rust-cross].
